A computational approach is developed for the systematic design of low-thrust transfers in the planar circular restricted three-body problem. 
Computational geometric optimal control is applied to compute the reachability set on Poincare sections.
This formulation of the optimal control problem preserves the underlying geometric features of the optimal trajectory.
Necessary conditions for optimality are derived and an efficient discrete solution method is proposed to solve the two point boundary value problem. 
Maximization of the reachability set enables the use of an iterative method to design optimal transfers between periodic orbits. 
Numerical examples illustrate the benefit of the discrete time formulation.
